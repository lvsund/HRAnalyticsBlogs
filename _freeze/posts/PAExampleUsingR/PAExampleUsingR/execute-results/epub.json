Most of these articles have hinted that there are many obstacles to the application of analytics to HR.\n\nThese obstacles for widespread evidence and use are predominantly human not technical:\n\n*\t__Data generation is not the problem.__ HR data availability and accessability has never been greater to HR professionals.\n*\t__Technology is not problem.__ Data science, machine learning, and analytic tools  are exploding on to the scene these days. Whether it is enhancements to the R statistical package, or other statistical packages, or developments in other tools like Microsoft Azure Machine Learning or RapidMiner as examples- there have never been more tools to be brought to bear on HR data. \n*\t__Application of the tools on the data IS the problem.__ (In this case lack thereof). \n\nThis lack of application can occur from:\n \n1.\t__The HR profession not seeing that most of HR is highly technical.__ In the past HR might have acknowleged the traditional areas such as salary and wage administration, or labor relations/collective bargaining costing was technical because it was seen as heavily dependent on calculation and data.  But for most of the rest of  the HR domain HR professionals think its non-technical- whether it be recruitment,training, Health and Safety, Benefits, engagement. To be sure, there are the 'human' sides of all areas of HR, but they are all 'as much technical as well. The technical has far too long being ignored by HR professionals.\n\n\tDr. John Sullivan, in the following article: \n\n\thttp://www.tlnt.com/2013/02/26/how-google-is-using-people-analytics-to-completely-reinvent-hr/ \n\n\tdescribes this as 'reliance on relationships'. 'Relationships are the antithesis  of analytical decsions making.' . \n\n2. __Not enough HR professionals seeking the informational and analytical side of the picture in their university/college  HR studies__ in preparation for the HR field, and not enough universities/colleges offering studies in People Analytics.\n\n3.\t __People Analytics- where it exists- being defining  too narrowly  as just  HR metrics  or predictive analytic tools to the HR domain.__ These are part of the picture-yes- but 'data driven' can include much more of the statistical methods than just predictive.\n\n4.  __Obstacles that organizations inadvertently put in the way__ - the 'sacred' requirement to develop a business case to 'get' resources to do any of this- particularly when 'starting' can be relatively free  to develop proof of concepts.\n\nI am a firm believer in 'skunkworks' projects-making do with, and showing what can be done with, what you already have or with what can be obtained free. __You will often need to show by simple example what can be done__ to justify more elaborate formal initiatives later and request additional formal resources.\n \nIts in that spirit, I wanted to walk through an example of People Analytics, and using free tools. __This wont  be a full fledged  best practices  or even a robust example.__ Rather it is intended to be a simple example to illustrate the process and some of the tools. Best  practices and robustness comes with learning, use, and mastery over a period of time. Most of us need to start 'simply' to start 'somewhere'.\n\nThis example will be   on one particular HR metric- absenteeism. __The data will be contrived.__ But it will illustrate very rudimentary People Analytics using the R statistical programming language.\n \nBut before we get into this though, we should cover some basic helpful definitions and frameworks. These will help show why we are doing what we are doing.\n\n#Terminology\n\n##People Analytics\nFirst of all, I do prefer the term 'People Analytics' as compared to some of the other terms used interchangeably. Per the title, I am going to use the term 'People Analytics' the way its implicitly defined in the previous article link provided\n\n__People analytics is a data-driven approach to managing people at work.__\n\n'Data-driven' is key. It dispels any notion that data and measurement are not part of managing people. (Sorry to those of you who felt managing people was restricted only to 'reliance on relationships')\n\n__People Analytics is what happens when you apply Data Science and its principles to the realm of People Management (HR).__\n\nIt means 'analysis of data' __then__ 'action'. And it means analysis __and__ action. You are managing people through being 'data driven'\nA lot of organizations who try to get people analytics started, get stuck at creation of HR metrics and the use of Business Intelligence tools. These can be and are part of the people analytics picture, to be sure. But  slicing and dicing , graphics and visualizations by  themselves only take you so far.  The addition of statistical analyses and taking informed action on your data are what will propel you forward.\n\nAnother reason why I like this definition is that 'data-driven' doesn't unintentionally restrict the type of analyses we do to be data driven. This can include exploratory analysis, predictive analysis, and experimental design. (Often people think only 'predictive' in the context of 'data driven'.)\n\nBecause we mention 'Data Science' in the context of People Analytics, it is important to define it next to understand why it is so tied to People Analytics.\n\n##Data Science\nI will share a few definitions.\n\n*\tIn their book Practical Data Science With R by Nina Zumel and John Mount\nhttps://www.manning.com/books/practical-data-science-with-r\n on page xix, they define data science as :\n'. managing the process that can transform hypotheses and data into actionable predictions.'\n\n*\tAnother definition is from the 'Field Guide to Data Science' by Booz, Allen , Hamilton- page 21:\nhttp://www.boozallen.com/insights/2015/12/data-science-field-guide-second-edition\nThey define data science as :\n'the art of turning data in actions'\n\n*\tAnd still another definition from 'Data Science For Business' by Foster Provost And Tom Fawcett:\nhttp://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028918.do\nData Science is a set of fundamental principles that guide the extraction of knowledge from data (page 2) .\nThe ultimate goal of data science .improving decision making. (page 5)\n\nAll of these definitions clearly line up as being totally consistent with the above definition provided for People Analytics. It means transforming HR hunches, guesses (or really hypotheses) into information/data , analyses, and management actions- actions supported by the data.\n\n\n#A Framework\n\nZumel/Mount 's definition  mentions 'process'.  Processes are always require to 'transform' something from 'what it is' to 'what it is to become' - 'data' into 'actions'. This becomes a framework that can guide our efforts and understanding.\nIn  their book 'Practical Data Science With R' they define the following process for data science on page 6:\n\nData Science\n \n*\t__Define a goal__\n*\t__Collect and Manage Data__\n*\t__Build The Model__\n*\t__Evaluate and Critique Model__\n*\t__Present Results and Document__\n*\t__Deploy Model__\n\nI don't want to belabor the above process significantly in this blog article, because entire books have and are being written on the subjects of data science, predictive analytics, data mining etc. But I will make some general comments about the above steps to set the stage for the illustrative, simple ,rudimentary R example to follow.\n\n1.\t__Define a goal__ ,as mentioned above, means identifying first what HR management business problem you are trying to solve. Without a problem/issue we don't have a goal.\n2.\t__Collect and Manage data.__ At its simplest, you want a 'dataset' of information perceived to be relevant to the problem. The collection and management of data could be a simple extract from the corporate Human Resource Information System, or an output from an elaborate Data Warehousing/Business Intelligence tool used on HR information. For purpose of this blog article illustration we will use a simple CSV file. It also involves exploring the data both for data quality issues, and for an initial look at what  the data may be telling you\n3.\t__Build The Model.__ This step really means, after you have defined the  HR business problem or goal you are trying to achieve, you pick a data mining approach/tool that is designed to address that type of problem. With absenteeism as an HR issue, are you trying to predict employee with propensity to high absenteeism from those who aren't? Are you trying to predict future absenteeism rates? Are you trying to define what is normal absenteeism from that which is atypical or and anomaly? The business problem/goal determine the appropriate data mining tools to consider. Not exhaustive as a list, but common data mining approaches used in modelling are classification,regression, anomaly detection, time series, clustering, association analyses to name a few. These approaches take information/data as inputs , run them through statistical algorithms, and produce output.\n4.\t__Evaluate and Critique Model.__ Each data mining approach can have many different statistical algorithms to bring to bear on the data. The evaluation is both what algorithms provide the most consistent accurate predictions on new data, and do we have all the relevant data or do we need more types of data to increase predictive accuracy of model on new data. This can be necessarily repetitive and circular activity over time to improve the model\n5.\t__Present Results And Document.__ When we have gotten out model to an acceptable ,useful predictive level, we document our activity and present results.  The definition of acceptable and useful is really relative to the organization, but in all cases would mean , results show improvement over what would have been otherwise. The principle behind data 'science' like any science, is that with the same data, people should be able to reproduce our findings/ results.\n6.\t__Deploy Model.__ The whole purpose of building the model ( which is on existing data) is to:\n\n* use the model on  future data when it becomes available, to predict or prevent something from happening before it occurs or\n* to better understand our existing business problem to tailor more specific responses\n\nBoth R and other solutions allow you to save the model, so it can be used on other data. Lets now turn to a rudimentary People Analytics (Data driven People Management(HR) example in R.\n\n__This blog article is 'Part 1'.__ The length of covering this in a single article would push the limits of comfortable reading length for a single article. So __part 1 will cover the  first 2 steps__ of the above process.\n\n#An R Example\n\n##1.Define the goal (or HR business problem/issue).\n\nA hypothetical company MFG has decided that it needs to at absenteeism. \nIt wants answers to the following questions:\n\n*\t__What is its rate of absenteeism?__\n*\t__Does anyone have excessive absenteeism?__ \n*\t__Is is the same across the organization?__\n*\t__Does it vary by gender?__\n*\t__Does it vary by  length of service or age?__ Its guesses are that initially age and length of service may be related to absenteeism rates.\n*\t__Can it predict next year's absenteeism?__\n*\t__If so, how well can it predict?__\n*\t__Can we reduce our absenteeism?__\n\nIf they can make future People Management decisions \"driven\" by what the data is telling them, then they will feel they have started the People Analytics journey.\n\n##2.Collect and Manage Data. \n\nLet us suppose this is a skunkworks project. Formal separate resources have not be identified for this initiative. \nOnly an initial look at recent data is possible. The HRIS system is able to provide some rudimentary information covering absences only for 2015\nIt was able to generate the following information as a CSV file (comma separated values):\n\n*\tEmployeeNumber\n*\tSurname\n*\tGivenName\n*\tGender\n*\tCity\n*\tJobTitle\n*\tDepartmentName \n*\tStoreLocation\n*\tDivision\n*\tAge\n*  LengthService\n*  AbsentHours\n*  BusinessUnit\n\n###Let's read in the data provided\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# MFGEmployees <- read.csv(\"~/R Files/MFGEmployees4.csv\")\nMFGEmployees <- read.csv(\"MFGEmployees4.csv\")\nstr(MFGEmployees)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n'data.frame':\t8336 obs. of  13 variables:\n $ EmployeeNumber: int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ Surname       : chr  \"Gutierrez\" \"Hardwick\" \"Delgado\" \"Simon\" ...\n $ GivenName     : chr  \"Molly\" \"Stephen\" \"Chester\" \"Irene\" ...\n $ Gender        : chr  \"F\" \"M\" \"M\" \"F\" ...\n $ City          : chr  \"Burnaby\" \"Courtenay\" \"Richmond\" \"Victoria\" ...\n $ JobTitle      : chr  \"Baker\" \"Baker\" \"Baker\" \"Baker\" ...\n $ DepartmentName: chr  \"Bakery\" \"Bakery\" \"Bakery\" \"Bakery\" ...\n $ StoreLocation : chr  \"Burnaby\" \"Nanaimo\" \"Richmond\" \"Victoria\" ...\n $ Division      : chr  \"Stores\" \"Stores\" \"Stores\" \"Stores\" ...\n $ Age           : num  32 40.3 48.8 44.6 35.7 ...\n $ LengthService : num  6.02 5.53 4.39 3.08 3.62 ...\n $ AbsentHours   : num  36.6 30.2 83.8 70 0 ...\n $ BusinessUnit  : chr  \"Stores\" \"Stores\" \"Stores\" \"Stores\" ...\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing we should do is check on quality of data.
