Hi Everyone,

This is just a short post.

For those of you who have read my previous LinkedIn blog articles and also for those who purchased my book- you will know that I referred to the use of R Rattle library as a GUI to do an immense amount of machine learning and data science analyses quickly on HR Data you may have authorization to analyze.

Because its a GUI it allows for a lot of point and click to do your initial analyses and also to generate the R core necessary behind the scenes for you -very powerful.

I just came across this article on R Bloggers and r4stats.com on describing the GUI part of this and its use- and found it to be a very good one:

Just thought I would share by forwarding it on.

Thanks
