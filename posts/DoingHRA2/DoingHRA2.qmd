Hi Everyone,

For those of you who are interested, the e-book that I announced in the last couple of weeks is now available in paperback form as well.

The e-book as per the previous information is available from www.analyticsinhr.com.

The paperback is available from amazon.com

Searching for 'Doing HR Analytics' on amazon.com should find it.

Hope it will be helpful to you on your People/HR Analytics journey...
