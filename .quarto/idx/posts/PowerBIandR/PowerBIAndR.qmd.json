But the order is\n\n1.tweak in code\n\n2.run the code\n\n3.produce the graphics\n\nAnd repeat as necessary\n\n \n\n \n\nHow Does Power BI do it?\n\nThe order for producing a decision tree:\n\n1.select the Power BI graphic\n\n2\\. tweak the graphic\n\n3\\. look at changes in graphic and the statistical results (yes- the R decision tree algorithm is run for you behind the scenes- each time you tweak the graphic\n\n# Let's See This in Action\n\n1.Grab the csv file from the link provided previously and store locally.\n\n2\\. if you haven't already done so download Power BI Desktop and install it:\n\n \n\n[[https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/powerbi-desktop-get-the-desktop/]{.underline}](http://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/powerbi-desktop-get-the-desktop/)\n\n \n\n3\\.

So now you should have R installed, Power BI Desktop installed, the R powered visuals installed. The next step is to launch Power BI desktop.\n\n \n\n5.Get Data\n\n![](pic2.jpeg)\n\n6.Import\n\n![](pic3.jpeg)\n\n![](pic4.jpeg)\n\n7\\. Load the data\n\n![](pic5.jpeg)\n\n8\\.

Now add other input variables by clicking more check boxes\n\n![](pic10.jpeg)\n\nThe relative error has dropped to .21.\n\nWhat has just happened?\n\nAs you made choices for extra input variable, the decision tree custom R-powered visual has rerun the algorithm behind the scenes for you- showing that you have improved your model. The decision tree shows (based on the data) what rules lead to what prediction of pay grade, and the error associated with those prediction.\n\nThis was done with no coding by you.\n\n# Closing Thoughts\n\nThe whole point of providing this example and in a hands-on way, was to illustrate several things:\n\n-   **People Analytics need not be scary**\n\n-   **You can use some tools readily available out there to show your organizations live examples of what's possible in People/HR Analytics**\n\n-   **Being able to interact with your graphics and visuals as the means to carry out algorithms in the background is very powerful and promising**\n\nThis is intended to demonstrate just one example and one tool. **None of the above precludes or dismisses the need for good statistical analysis, R, HR, coding, and data science skills for much more robust, proper and comprehensive People / HR analytics.** But tools such as this can be very useful as part of what can be brought to bear for organizations on their analytics journey.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Introduction\n\nOne of things I try to do in the field of People Analytics is monitor and try out new tools and technologies that come out that appear to add value to People Analytics.\n\nIn doing just that, I came across a very cool and nifty unexpected behavior in one tool- Microsoft Power BI.\n\nAlthough, many of my previous blogs have been lengthy (by necessity), this one will be quite a bit shorter because my real intent is to show a gem of unexpected behavior I came across because of using the above tool on an HR dataset.
